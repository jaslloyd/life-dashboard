# Life Dashboard

A Dashboard to track various parts of my life, I use a lot of tools for tracking different things and I want a central place to keep track of all these things. Some of these things are:

- Habits
- Finance, Investment Portfolio, Budget etc.
- Todo's
- Time Tracking
- Keeping track of notes

## Why I am doing this

The main reason is to solve the problems I personally have which I think is a great reason to start a big project. I also want to use this Dashboard to try out new technologies or anything, the first list of technologies I want to learn more about is:

- Monorepos
- Microfrontends / Module Federation
- Server side rendering
- GraphQL
- Webpack from scratch
- [insert more here...]

## Resources

This concept already exists but I want to make it personal to me and maybe later make it more generic.
