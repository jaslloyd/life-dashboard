# Dashboard Shell

This is the application shell, this application will pull in all the other applications. This will be the homepage for the application, the idea will be each dashboard application will be its own separate application that at run-time dashboard will fetch all the remote applications and serve them up.

Module Federation allows us to accomplish the above!
